Repository for learning the basics of Git and GitHub

## Introduction :

Here is a resource for learning the basics of Git and GitHub through practice. I am unfamiliar with these two tools because I have never used them before. I am eager to learn how to use them because they seem very useful.

More seriously I'm happy to learn how to use Git because it will allow me to keep track of my changes. 
I think it will also improve my ability to organize my data (and share it).
I want to improve my Python and R skills because my internship project requires me to perform statistics and data analysis, and these tools are very helpful.
I know I'm struggling with Python, but I'm going to stick with it because I know it will be very useful!
